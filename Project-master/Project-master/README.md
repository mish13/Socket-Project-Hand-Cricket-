# Project Hand Cricket
We have submitted 3 packages here.
We have implemented a Multi-client supported system using multi-treads which through which the full game can be played. The "HandCricketnew" package contains all the source codes and resources for it.
We have implemented a Server-client system also to play the whole game with the server. The "HandCrick" package contains all the source codes and resources for it.
We have designed a GUI for the game, but couldn't yet sync it with the back-end because of some critical problems and we are working on it. We will complete it as soon as possible. The "JFrame" package contains the full game a not-synced GUI. You are requested to download the 'JTattoo-1.6.11.jar' file and add it to the library of the package to have the full theme.
